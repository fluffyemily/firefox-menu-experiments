# firefox-menu-experiments
Test Project to explore implementation possibilities for the [new menu](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1210109) for [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios)

Current master is first pass. Subsequent branches will be exploring other routes. When a route has been decided upon it will get merged with master and then implmented on [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-ios)
